## Definition

Button is a clickable, interactive element that triggers a response.
It can contain text and icons and is often used for actions such as form submissions or toggling elements into view.
The component is flexible and customizable, supporting different HTML elements (button, a, or input) via the as prop.

The Button component also supports the use of a ref, which is forwarded to the underlying DOM element or custom component specified by the as prop.
This allows developers to directly access the DOM node or component instance for tasks such as focusing the element, measuring dimensions, or integrating with third-party libraries.
The ref type dynamically adapts based on the element type passed to as, ensuring strong type safety.

By default, the Button inherits all the standard properties of the specified HTML element or React component, including:

- **Button Props**: For as="button", it supports all native button attributes such as type, onClick, disabled, and aria-\* attributes for accessibility.
- **Anchor (Link) Props**: For as="a", it supports attributes like href, target, rel, and others.
- **Input (Button) Props**: For as="input", it supports attributes like type, onClick, disabled, and others.
