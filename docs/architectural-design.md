# High-Level Architectural Overview

## **Project Name: Component Library Accelerator**

- **Purpose**: This project contains the codebase to generate quickly a component library.
- **Scripts**:
  - Individual scripts for local development (`dev`), building (`build`), and testing (`test` variants).
  - Linting and formatting (`prettier` and `lint` scripts).
  - Scripts for the React Sandbox, the storybook and the library generation.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Frontend libraries like React, Tailwindcss, Storybook, etc.
  - Development tools for testing (Jest, Testing Library), linting (ESLint), and types (TypeScript, @types libraries).

### **Components Overview**

- **Frontend Framework**: React (Vite), Storybook, Vite package generation,
- **Styles**: Tailwindcss
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier

### Enhanced Architectural Design

#### **1. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

- **CI Workflow**:

  - **Code Commit**: On every commit, `husky` triggers lint and test scripts ensuring that only quality code is integrated.

  - **Automated Testing**: Includes unit tests, integration tests, and possibly end-to-end tests running in headless browsers, providing comprehensive feedback on the health of the application before it proceeds to deployment.

- **CD Workflow**:

  - **Automatic Deployment**: Post successful CI runs, the `build` script compiles the application for production, which can then be deployed to a server or cloud environment automatically.

#### **2. Developer Tools and Automation**

- **Code Quality Assurance**:

  - **ESLint/Prettier Integration**: Maintains coding standards and styles across the project, ensuring consistency and reducing style-related issues in code reviews.

- **Pre-commit Hooks**:

  - **`lint-staged`**: Runs linters on staged git files, preventing commits with lint errors, thus enhancing code quality and reducing the need for code review iterations.
